** Documenting Things I learned **

19/09/24

Today, we started actaully implementing the Linked List Strucutre, doing so we learned about recursivly
calling a function in a structure, this idea is the foundation of the linked list, as this is what allows
us to set the pointer to the next, node in the linked list, next we took steps to implement this and actaully
learned what the pointers are doing what they are doing and how to properly declare them, we also learned how to allocate memory for the next structure dynamically by implementing the add function add(), we also learned how to itterate 
over the linked list in the creation of a new function print_list().
